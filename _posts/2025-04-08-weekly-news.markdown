In this week's Progressive Pulse... Trump's tariff policies dominate global economic discussions, sparking trade wars and threatening economic instability. The Global South faces disproportionate impacts, with Africa and Latin America particularly vulnerable. Meanwhile, the ongoing crisis in Gaza highlights the urgent need for international accountability and an end to the violence. The working class faces increasing pressure from economic policies favoring the wealthy, requiring solidarity and resistance to build a more just and equitable world.

 ### Trump's Tariff Tsunami: A Class War Unleashed
Trump's sweeping tariffs have ignited a global firestorm, threatening to destabilize the world economy and further immiserate the working class. The immediate reaction has been widespread condemnation, with over 1, 000 anti-Trump protests erupting worldwide and stock markets plunging.

The working class in both the US and abroad will bear the brunt of these tariffs through higher prices and job losses. Poorer countries reliant on trade with the US, like Lesotho, face devastation of key industries. Meanwhile, corporations and billionaires like Elon Musk stand to benefit from the chaos through market manipulation and privatization schemes.

China has retaliated with tariffs of its own, escalating the trade war and accelerating the decline of US hegemony. BRICS nations are exploring alternative economic alliances, potentially reshaping the global order. Europe is scrambling to forge a united front against Trump's protectionism, while Southeast Asian nations like Singapore are forming task forces to mitigate the damage.

The long-term consequences of Trump's tariffs remain uncertain, but one thing is clear: they represent a reckless gamble with the livelihoods of working people around the world, enriching the elite while exacerbating inequality and instability.

### International

Trump's tariffs spark global turmoil, threatening economic collapse and a return to "fair trade, " impacting the global working class. The US and Israel face criticism for actions in Gaza and elsewhere. BRICS nations explore alternatives to the US-dominated financial order. NATO's role and the weaponization of human rights are questioned.
