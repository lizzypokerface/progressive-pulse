In this week's Progressive Pulse…

The global landscape is shifting as nations like China, Russia, and India challenge the existing world order, particularly the dominance of the US dollar. This multipolar push is evident in initiatives like BRICS' focus on AI and energy, and in the SCO summit where leaders presented a united front. Meanwhile, the crisis in Gaza continues to draw international attention, with flotillas attempting to break the blockade and accusations of genocide. In North America, concerns are rising about Trump's policies and their impact on immigrants and democratic norms.

# Global  

The dominance of the US dollar is being questioned as China, India, Russia, and Iran unite, encouraging de-dollarization. BRICS is pushing for AI independence and exploring an electricity alliance. China, Russia, and India are building a new world order, challenging transatlantic hegemony. Trump accuses China, Russia, and North Korea of conspiring against the US.
