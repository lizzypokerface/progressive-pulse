In this week’s Progressive Pulse… The world grapples with interconnected crises, from the ongoing violence in Gaza to the economic fallout of Trump's policies and the looming threat of climate change. While global powers convene at summits and negotiate trade deals, grassroots movements are rising up to demand justice, accountability, and a more equitable distribution of resources. The expansion of BRICS and the growing influence of the Global South offer a potential counterweight to Western dominance, but also raise questions about the future of international cooperation and the pursuit of sustainable development. As AI continues to transform the global economy, concerns are growing about its impact on workers and the potential for increased inequality.

### International

Discussions focus on the global implications of Trump's policies, including tax cuts and their impact on billionaires. The BRICS alliance continues to expand, with Vietnam joining, and its role in challenging the US dollar's dominance is being examined. Concerns are also raised about sustainable development and unsustainable debt in the Global South.
