In this week’s Progressive Pulse… The world teeters on the brink of a wider war as the US and Israel escalate their conflict with Iran, diverting attention from the ongoing genocide in Gaza. This crisis is fueled by a complex web of economic interests, including control over rare earth minerals and oil resources, with the BRICS nations emerging as key players in the shifting geopolitical landscape. Meanwhile, ordinary people are bearing the brunt of the conflict, from the streets of Tehran to the farms of California, where immigration raids are terrorizing workers. As the drums of war beat louder, voices of dissent are rising, demanding an end to the violence and a more just and peaceful world.

Escalating Conflict in the Middle East and its Global Repercussions: The US-Israeli conflict with Iran is not isolated; it has far-reaching implications. The potential disruption of oil supplies through the Strait of Hormuz could trigger a global inflationary shock. The conflict is also exacerbating the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where Palestinians face famine. The involvement of major global powers like the US, China, and Russia is creating deep divisions within international bodies like the UN Security Council. This situation is prompting a realignment of global alliances and raising questions about the future of international cooperation.

### International

The US airstrikes on Iran have heightened global tensions, sparking fears of a wider conflict. Discussions revolve around whether this is a move for US global dominance, potentially targeting China and impacting the BRICS economic alliance. The possibility of Iran closing the Strait of Hormuz raises concerns about global oil supplies.
