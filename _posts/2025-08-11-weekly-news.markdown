In this week's Progressive Pulse…

Global events are increasingly shaped by the economic and political tensions between the U. S. and the BRICS nations, with Trump's tariffs acting as a key pressure point. The human cost of conflict is starkly evident in Gaza, where Israeli actions are drawing international condemnation amid a humanitarian crisis. Meanwhile, the Global South faces challenges from aid cuts and economic pressures, even as some countries explore closer ties with China. Internally, the U. S. grapples with rising inequality and the influence of its military-industrial complex. These interconnected issues highlight the need for alternative economic models and a shift away from unilateral coercive measures to foster a more equitable and peaceful world order.

# Global  

Trump is intensifying trade wars, particularly against BRICS nations, leading to discussions on how the world can free itself from U. S. financial dominance. BRICS is seen by some as signaling an end to U. S. dominance, while others view the U. S. dollar system as facing internal contradictions. The UN's effectiveness in stopping wars and potential reforms are also being considered.
