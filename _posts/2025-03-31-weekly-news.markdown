In this week's Progressive Pulse... The world witnesses escalating tensions, particularly in West Asia, where the ongoing Israeli aggression against Palestinians continues despite international outcry. The US continues to exert its influence through economic and military means, facing criticism for its policies and actions. Meanwhile, the rise of BRICS offers a potential alternative to the US-dominated global order. Across the globe, people are protesting injustice, from the streets of Turkey to university campuses in the US, underscoring the ongoing struggle for peace, justice, and economic equality.

### International

The US wages economic war on China, while Trump's policies favor the rich and bring inflation. Discussions on the weaponization of human rights and the US occupation of Greenland raise concerns. BRICS explores alternatives to the US-dominated financial order. The US-Russia talks stall, and escalation is expected.
