In this week‚Äôs Progressive Pulse‚Ä¶ The global landscape is increasingly shaped by economic tensions and geopolitical realignments. Trump's tariff threats are causing ripples across the globe, impacting trade relationships and forcing nations to seek alternative alliances, as seen with BRICS. The ongoing conflict in Gaza continues to draw international condemnation, particularly towards Israel's actions and the US's support. Meanwhile, domestic issues such as student loan debt in the US and social unrest in Ecuador highlight the growing inequalities and challenges faced by ordinary citizens. The push for a multipolar world order gains momentum as nations explore new avenues for cooperation and resistance against Western dominance.

### International

BRICS is growing stronger and resisting the US dollar and Western imperialism, even as Trump threatens it. Only a tiny percentage of the world's adults own nearly half of the world's wealth. Disinformation is a major industry. The UN is still important but deliberately undermined by member states.
