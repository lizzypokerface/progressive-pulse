In this week's Progressive Pulse‚Ä¶

The world stage is dominated by a shifting power balance, with many nations seeking alternatives to the existing US-led order. The SCO summit highlighted the growing cooperation between China, Russia, and India, while BRICS continues to expand its influence. Meanwhile, the devastating conflict in Gaza persists, drawing international condemnation. Economic tensions simmer as countries grapple with issues like debt, sanctions, and trade imbalances. These events signal a move towards a multipolar world, where nations are forging new alliances and challenging established norms, even as conflicts and humanitarian crises demand urgent attention.

The UN turned 80 amid discussions about its role in a changing world. The US faces accusations of supporting drug trafficking in Latin America while tensions rise with Venezuela. China, India, Russia, and Iran are reportedly uniting against what they perceive as US bullying, potentially accelerating de-dollarization. BRICS and the SCO are seen as key in building a multipolar world order.
