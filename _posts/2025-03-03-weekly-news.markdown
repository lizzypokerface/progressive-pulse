In this week's Progressive Pulse... Global power dynamics face dramatic realignment as US hegemony continues to decline. China leads technological innovation through developments like DeepSeek AI, while Trump's colonial ambitions for Ukraine highlight American imperialism's desperate phase. Israel's ongoing assault on Gaza persists despite ceasefire negotiations, with mounting evidence of war crimes. The Global South increasingly asserts independence through BRICS expansion and economic sovereignty initiatives. Worker struggles intensify worldwide against privatization and austerity, while far-right forces gain ground in Europe. Peace talks between Russia and US proceed without EU involvement, exposing NATO's internal tensions.

### International

Global power shift accelerates with China's technological leadership and US decline. Trump's plans for Ukraine colonization face resistance. BRICS expansion challenges Western dominance. Growing calls for multipolarity and international law over "rules-based order."
