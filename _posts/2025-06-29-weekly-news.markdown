In this week‚Äôs Progressive Pulse‚Ä¶ Despite a fragile ceasefire in the Middle East, the underlying tensions and power struggles continue to shape global events. The US-led push for increased military spending within NATO is raising concerns about its impact on social welfare programs in Europe, even as China offers alternative economic partnerships to African nations. Meanwhile, the devastating humanitarian crisis in Gaza and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine underscore the human cost of these geopolitical rivalries. As the world grapples with these interconnected challenges, movements for peace and social justice are gaining momentum, demanding a shift away from militarism and towards a more equitable and sustainable future.

### International

Discussions continue about the US-Iran conflict, with some analysts suggesting a ceasefire was sought by Netanyahu. The role of NATO and its increasing military spending (5% of GDP) is debated, alongside its relationship with China and Russia. The future of the UN is also under scrutiny as BRICS considers alternatives.
