In this week’s Progressive Pulse… The world is on edge as tensions between the US, Israel, and Iran escalate, threatening a wider conflict. Trump's policies, from military interventions to attacks on immigrants, are facing widespread resistance. The global economic order is shifting, with China playing an increasingly prominent role. Meanwhile, grassroots movements are fighting for social justice and economic equality.

### International

Trump sends the military to suppress protests in Los Angeles and launches a war on Iran. The US and China hold trade talks amid ongoing tensions. Experts discuss whether China's RMB can shield the world from a collapsing dollar system. The G7 summit concludes without a joint communique.

### West Asia (Middle East)

Israel's attacks on Iran have triggered retaliatory missile strikes, pushing the region closer to full-scale war. Reports suggest the US may have been involved in the initial attacks, which targeted nuclear facilities and military leaders. Trump demands Iran's "unconditional surrender, " while analysts warn of a dangerous escalation. Civilians are caught in the crossfire, and a global march to Gaza activists were attacked and detained in Egypt. There are concerns about the potential for regional destabilization and wider international involvement.
