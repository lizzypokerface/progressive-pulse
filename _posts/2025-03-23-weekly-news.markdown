In this week's Progressive Pulse... The world is on edge as geopolitical tensions escalate, particularly in West Asia where Israel's renewed assault on Gaza has sparked international outrage. Meanwhile, the US continues to exert its influence through military actions and economic policies, often at the expense of working people and social justice movements. The rise of BRICS offers a potential alternative to the US-dominated global order, but challenges remain in ensuring equitable and sustainable development. The struggle for peace, justice, and economic equality continues on multiple fronts, demanding solidarity and resistance from the working class worldwide.

### International

Global tensions escalate as Trump and Putin discuss Ukraine, while Israel resumes its assault on Gaza. BRICS nations explore alternatives to the US-dominated financial order, opening doors while the US closes them. Discussions on the weaponization of human rights and the return of German militarism raise concerns.
