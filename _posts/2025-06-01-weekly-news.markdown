In this week’s Progressive Pulse…
U. S. imperialism intensifies trade and currency battles, targeting China’s high-tech growth and sanctioning Global-South countries to retain dollar hegemony. Meanwhile, the Middle East endures an Israeli blockade and threatened Iranian negotiations. Africa and Latin America seek multipolar finance and sovereignty, pivoting away from IMF austerity. Europe’s militarization deepens, fueling the Ukraine proxy conflict. Russia weathers sanctions through alternative revenue, and Asia’s realignments highlight state-led industrial strategies over neoliberal dogma. Everywhere, working classes resist exploitation and forced displacement, forging alliances that transcend Atlantic consensus and embolden multipolar development paths.

### International

Trump intensifies trade wars, sanctions, and threats to keep U. S. hegemony afloat. Hunger crises reveal lethal inequalities. Marxist analyses highlight how currency dominance and financial warfare hamper Global-South development. Calls for multipolar cooperation grow, with emergent alliances challenging IMF dictates, ensuring sovereignty beyond Washington-led rules.

### China

Beijing denounces U. S. militarism, invests heavily in AI healthcare, Belt and Road infrastructure, and advanced carriers. Despite sanctions, Chinese state-led industrial strategy widens global influence, forging new mediation pacts with over 30 nations. Tensions over fishing disputes and trade curbs underscore rival geoeconomic claims in East Asia.

### South Asia

India’s government fails its own bonded-laborer rehabilitation goals, revealing deep class exploitation. Infrastructure ties in Pakistan expand via Chinese dam projects, fueling Belt-and-Road connectivity. India-Pakistan tensions persist, with U. S. arms overshadowed by cheaper Chinese weapons, highlighting shifts in global arms race and multipolar competition.

### Southeast Asia

ASEAN positions itself amid U. S.-China tariff battles, forging deeper ties with GCC for trade diversification. Malaysia’s “active non-alignment” moves highlight rejection of imperial dictates. Singapore’s Shangri-La Dialogue reveals attempts to contain China, yet regional states seek infrastructure funds, balanced investments, and strategic autonomy beyond Western dictates.

### East Asia

South Korea’s new voters show sharp gender divides, reflecting broader economic anxieties. Rising militarism across the peninsula ties into Washington’s push for arms deals. Regional stability remains precarious as U. S. containment strategies intensify, risking further escalation and entrenching dependency on dollar-driven alliances.

* [`South China Morning Post` 1st time voters divided among gender lines in South Korea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-rRw3sV72A)

### West Asia (Middle East)

Israel intensifies a starvation blockade on Gaza, faced with global condemnation but limited Western pushback. U. S.-Iran nuclear talks stall under Israeli sabotage threats. Washington’s complicity in siege underscores finance-driven imperial interests. Palestinian resistance broadens, highlighting a potential shift against settler-colonial impunity and for anti-imperialist solidarity.

### Russia

Kremlin balances war costs and domestic stability as sanctions fail to cripple its economy. Analysts debate whether Russia has effectively ‘won’ in Ukraine. Diplomatic solutions stall, with Washington’s proxy approach intensifying. Despite internal critique, Moscow leverages energy revenue and emerging alliances to resist NATO’s encirclement.

* [`Telesur English` Russia   Armed forces liberate strategic town from Ukraine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSuCjiHlJzA)

### Europe

E. U. militarization deepens, overshadowing calls for diplomacy in Ukraine. IMF austerity stokes tension in Balkan states, echoing Yugoslavia’s collapse under structural adjustment. Anti-war voices face censorship as Atlantic blocs push further arms spending. Ireland’s genocide declaration on Gaza signals cracks in Western alignment.

### Africa

Imperialist pressure persists as Washington targets Eritrea, Nigeria faces climate-driven disasters, and IMF debt demands overshadow essential services. African nations push back through multipolar ties, especially with China, prioritizing AI training, food security, and industrial self-sufficiency. Regional blocs seek ceasefire solutions in hotspots like Libya and DRC.
