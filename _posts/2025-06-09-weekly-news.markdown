In this week’s Progressive Pulse… Geopolitical tensions are escalating, with the US preparing for potential conflict with China and a renewed focus on the war in Ukraine. Trump's policies, including his travel ban and budget cuts, are facing widespread condemnation. The crisis in Gaza continues, with accusations of war crimes and humanitarian disasters. Meanwhile, movements for social and economic justice are gaining momentum, from protests against ICE raids in the US to calls for European unity against militarization. The role of international institutions like the UN is being questioned.

### International

The US military is preparing for potential war with China. Asia is uniting, creating a new global order. A worldwide march from Egypt to Gaza is planned. BRICS nations are strategizing their gold reserves. Trump's travel ban sparks global outcry. The US vetoes a UN Gaza ceasefire resolution.
