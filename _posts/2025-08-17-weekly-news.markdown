In this week's Progressive Pulse…

The world is seeing a realignment of power as the US faces challenges on multiple fronts. Trump's trade policies are backfiring, pushing nations like India closer to China and strengthening BRICS as an alternative to US dominance. The situation in the Middle East remains dire, with ongoing violence and accusations against Israel. Meanwhile, in North America, concerns are rising about potential overreach of executive power. These events underscore a growing tension between unilateral actions and the push for a more multipolar world, where international cooperation and economic diversification are becoming increasingly important. The push and pull between these forces will likely shape the global landscape in the coming years.

# Global  

Trump bragged about ending the Nord Stream pipeline, increasing EU dependence on the US for energy. His tariffs on India are pushing it closer to China, strengthening the BRICS alliance. Talks between Trump and Putin in Alaska occurred amidst a backdrop of the Ukraine war and discussions about a new world order. BRICS is seen as a counter to US dominance, with its bank marking 10 years of building a new financial world order.

# China  

China is making strides in AI, with new tools outperforming humans in cancer detection. Despite trade tensions, China hasn't moved to zero tariffs on US imports. The nation is also focused on green development and expanding cross-border cooperation through initiatives like the Lianyungang Port. Trump has confirmed a deal allowing Nvidia to sell lower-end chips to China and has extended the tariff truce for 90 days.
