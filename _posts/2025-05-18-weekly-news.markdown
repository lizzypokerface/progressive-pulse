In this week's Progressive Pulse... The world is witnessing a dangerous escalation of conflicts, particularly in West Asia, where the ongoing genocide in Gaza continues with the support of US imperialism. Trump's foreign policy maneuvers, from the Middle East to Ukraine, reveal a chaotic and self-serving agenda. Meanwhile, the US faces internal challenges, including crackdowns on student activists and a mental health crisis exacerbated by capitalism. Despite these grim realities, there are signs of resistance and solidarity, from the protests in London to the growing ties between China and Latin America. The struggle for a more just and peaceful world demands vigilance, organization, and unwavering commitment to social justice.

### International

Global power dynamics shift as Trump negotiates with Gulf monarchies while bashing interventionism, even eyeing Gaza. BRICS explores alternatives to the Western-dominated system. Concerns rise over the weaponization of human rights and increasing militarism. COVID origins are debated, and trade tensions between the US and China continue.
