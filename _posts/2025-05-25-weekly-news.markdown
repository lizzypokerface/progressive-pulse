In this week's Progressive Pulse... The world is increasingly fractured, with Trump's policies creating instability and division on multiple fronts. The humanitarian crisis in Gaza demands immediate attention and accountability for war crimes. BRICS nations offer a potential counterweight to US dominance, but face their own challenges. The struggle for Palestinian liberation, economic justice, and an end to imperialist interventions continues, requiring solidarity and resistance from progressive forces worldwide. The rise of China as a global power is undeniable, challenging the US-led order and reshaping international relations.

### International

Global landscape dominated by Trump's actions and BRICS challenge to US hegemony. Trump engages in peace talks with Russia and Ukraine, while also threatening trade wars. BRICS nations explore alternative financial systems. Concerns rise over weaponization of human rights and media coverage of Gaza genocide.
