# Progressive Pulse
### News for the People
#### A weekly digest of socialist news and insights.

# Pre-requisites
Before you start, make sure you have the following installed on your system:
- Ruby (version 3.1.4)
- RubyGems (Ruby's package manager)
- GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)
- Make (build automation tool)

These tools are essential for setting up and running a Jekyll site.

# Setting Up for Local Development
Follow these steps to set up your local environment for developing the Jekyll static site:

1. **Install Bundler:**
   Navigate to the project root directory in your terminal and run:
   ```bash
   gem install bundler
   ```
   Bundler manages Ruby gem dependencies, making it easier to handle Jekyll's requirements.

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Install the required gems specified in your Gemfile:
   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```
   This command installs all the necessary dependencies for your Jekyll site.

3. **Build the Site:**
   Compile your site's source code into static files:
   ```bash
   jekyll build
   ```
   This step generates the static site files in the `_site` directory.

4. **Serve the Site Locally:**
   Start a local server to view your Jekyll site:
   ```bash
   bundle exec jekyll serve
   ```
   This allows you to view your site in a web browser at `http://localhost:4000`.

### Accessing the Site Locally
Once you've successfully run the above commands, you can access your Jekyll site by navigating to `http://localhost:4000` in your web browser. This local server will reflect any changes you make to the site as you develop.

# Development Guidelines

The primary focus of development is the addition of new posts. To contribute, follow these steps to add new entries to the `_posts` folder:

### Creating a New Post

1. **Create a New Branch:**
   - Create a branch for your new post using the format: `feat/<new-post-title>`.
   - Example: `git checkout -b feat/my-awesome-post`.

2. **Navigate to the _posts Directory:**
   - In your local repository, navigate to the `_posts` directory.

3. **Create a New Markdown File:**
   - File name format: `YYYY-MM-DD-NAME-OF-POST.markdown`.
   - Replace `YYYY-MM-DD` with the date of your post and `NAME-OF-POST` with the title of your post.
   - Example: `2024-01-01-my-awesome-post.markdown`.

4. **Add YAML Frontmatter:**
   - At the top of the file, include the following frontmatter:
     ```yaml
     layout: post
     title: "Your Post Title"
     date: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS +/-TTTT
     categories: category1 category2
     ```
   - Replace placeholders with your post's details.

5. **Add Content:**
   - Follow the provided template to add your content after the YAML frontmatter.
   - Remove any categories for which there are no articles.
   - Feel free to add new categories as needed.
   - Create timestamps with the following shell command: `$ date +'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %z'`
   - Below is an example content template:

     ```markdown
     ---
     layout: post
     title:  "âœŠ Progressive News | 01 Jan 2024"
     date:   2024-01-01 03:58:56 +0800

6. **Commit Your Changes:**
   - Use the commit message template: `feat: YYYY-MM-DD-NAME-OF-POST added`.
   - Example: `git commit -m "feat: 2024-01-01-my-awesome-post added"`.

7. **Create a Pull Request:**
   - Push your branch to GitHub and create a pull request for your proposed changes.
   - Example: `git push origin feat/my-awesome-post`.

8. **Pull Request Review and Deployment:**
   - Each pull request will be thoroughly reviewed. If it is approved, it will be merged into the main branch.
   - Upon a new commit to the main branch, the site will be automatically deployed via GitHub Actions to [Progressive Pulse](https://glennlum.github.io/progressive-pulse/), ensuring that the latest content is always available.

## Best Practices for Contributors
- **Relevance:** Ensure your post aligns with the blog's theme, contributing meaningful insights and perspectives to the discourse on socialism.
- **Accuracy:** Diligently proofread your post for spelling and grammatical accuracy to maintain the blog's quality and professionalism.
- **Formatting:** Adhere to Markdown formatting standards. Use the [Markdown Formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mervin.markdown-formatter) for consistent and clean formatting of your `.md` files.
- **Link Verification:** Regularly check that all hyperlinks in your post are functional and directly relevant to the content, providing readers with reliable and valuable resources.

By following these guidelines, you can contribute effectively to the 'Progressive Pulse' blog and help maintain a high standard of content.
